# Library_Social_App

Building a web app for college students to connect while at the library.
Students have profiles, friends, and statuses.
Statuses can include where the student is located, if they're open to social work time,
if they want to go on a walk/ grab food, etc. 
This app will address a need that I experienced while on my campus; on long library days
during finals week, I would wonder which of my friends happened to be in the same building
as me and might want to meet up. App is to be used for social and study purposes.
Future goals include in-app messenger.
